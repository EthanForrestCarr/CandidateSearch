## Description
CandidateSearch is a dynamic, front-end application that connects to a custom API to retrieve data from the GitHub API and renders this data in the browser, providing a streamlined way to explore and save potential job candidates. The application's backend API, which interfaces with GitHub's API, is pre-built. The task here is to complete the front-end in TypeScript, integrating the backend API, and deploy the entire project to Render.

## Usage

The command-line interface will prompt you to create or select a vehicle, and allow you to perform various actions based on the type of vehicle chosen. Trucks have unique actions like towing, and motorbikes can wheelie.
